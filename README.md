#Here is a more detailed description of the project:

The NewsRoom-React project is a React application that displays news articles from the News API. The application is bootstrapped with Create React App, which provides a great starting point for React projects. JWT tokens are used for user authentication and authorization, and news articles are fetched from the News API using the Axios library. The articles are displayed in a list view, and there is also a search functionality. Unit and integration tests are written using Jest, and the project is deployed to Heroku.

The project was a great learning experience for me, and I was able to learn a lot about React, the News API, JWT tokens, Axios, unit testing, and deployment. I am confident that I can use the skills I learned from this project to contribute to your team and help you achieve your goals.
